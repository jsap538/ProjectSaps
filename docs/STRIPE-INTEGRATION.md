## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Payment form doesn't load

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify environment variables in Vercel
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

**Solution:**
- Go to Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables
- Verify both keys are set
- Redeploy if you just added them

### Problem: "Order not found" after payment

**Check:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for errors in Network tab
- Check `/api/orders` POST response

**Common causes:**
- User not signed in
- Empty cart
- Database connection issue

### Problem: Webhook not triggering

**Check:**
```bash
# Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Your endpoint
# Look for recent events
# Status should be 200

# If 404 or 500:
- Webhook URL is correct: /api/webhooks/stripe
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set in Vercel
- Endpoint is deployed (push to main)
```

**Manually test webhook:**
1. Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Click your endpoint
3. Click "Send test webhook"
4. Select: `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Check response
